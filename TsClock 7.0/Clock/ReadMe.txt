Updates - Version History
========================================================
v 7.0.392
The program has been rewritten from scratch. There were
simply too many maintenance problems to keep the old
code. As a result, the code is much more efficeint. The
clock takes up 50% less memory and uses up 75% less cpu
time, allowing the clock to perform well even on 'low'
spec computers. The lowest spec computer this program
has been tested on is 133Mhz cpu, 16Mb RAM. The options
layout and general program interface has changed 
slightly, both to take up less hard disk space and for 
clearer display for the user. The clock has also been
made resizeable and has a new background option to let
it blend in with the desktop wallpaper. The analog 
clock graphics have been improved. New option added,
Start Hidden. This allows the program to start 
inconspicuously with only the system tray icon 
visible. Three program eggs have been added. Should
anyone find all three program eggs, I will give them
the full source code if they so wish (the source code
is written in Visual Basic 6.0).
The system tray icon will now reload itself should
explorer restart. This has been bugging me for a
while now :)

- Eric

========================================================
v 6.4.293
Code overhaul done. About screen code redone to be 
faster, intelligent saving, more protection against
ini file data corruption (can be annoying). The program
in general has been stripped of unnecessary code and
has more internal checks to make sure it is as stable
as possible.

v 6.3.287
The mouse cursor is now animated to move to the "Yes" 
button when the computer asks to shut down the computer.
New Option: Prevent other applications from closing 
windows. This means that you can now stop others from 
shutting down windows until the clock shuts it down 
itself. You can override this by using the end-task window 
or turning the option Off.
A small bug with customized title bar sizes when 
switching between analogue and digital modes is now 
fixed.
A major overhaul on code effeciency and graphical info.
Unnecessary code has been stripped down and deleted
from the program for faster loading times and better
program execution.
The program now uses less cpu time. The main cause for
this was checking for the idle time. As stated above,
this was updated for more efficient use of resources.

v 6.2.264
New option: In the Shutdown Options screen, there is a
new set of options called Idle Time. With these options
the program can now shutdown your computer after it has 
been idle for a specified amount of time (like a 
screensaver).
New option: Start Minimized. This will make the program
start as a minimized icon instead of a window. 
New option: Change System Time. This will let you change
the computers' local time. Note: on Win NT you will need
the appropiate security rights to change the time.
New option: Snap Window. This will snap the clock to the
side of the desktop like winamp.
About screen has been redone (no flicker). Fixed bug
when loading invalid background picture.
The clock now records where you left it before the program
terminated. This means that you can move it to a part of 
the screen and the clock will always start there until you
move it.
I finally managed to rid the Time box of its flicker. 
I know I've said this before, but there was always
a little tell-tale flicker. Anyway, even this has (to my 
relief) been totally eradicated.
Also some fine tuning to the code has been done to speed
up the program and make it more aesthetically pleasing.

v 6.1.187
Shut down related bug fixes. About screen has been re-
done. 
New option: Always On Top. This will put the clock on 
top of what ever screen is currently active.

v 6.0.178
I've added two new screens to the program. A Password
screen and a Colour Schemes screen. Also, you can now
double-click on the system-tray icon to show the clock
instead of using the menu (the option is still there
though). Some animation for when you try to exit the
program when the Timed Shut-down is still active, helps
let you know that the program hasn't stoped running.
Also a password decryption bug was fixed (slight error
during coding). 
A new option was added aswell. The 'Run At Startup'
option lets you customize whether or not the program
will activate itself every time windows is started.
That annoying flicker is also fixed (to my relief).

========================================================
v 5.9.163
Program now finds the licensed user in about 2 seconds,
instead of 10 minutes. New password protection. Double
click on sys-tray icon to show clock.

v 5.8.153
Some bug fixes. Default background setting changed. File
path validation in code for background.

v 5.7.151
Increase .ini ledgability and a new option on the 
"Shut Down Options" screen. You can choose your shut down
method (this increases compatability). Also faster code
in search for licensed owner (by approx 60 times).

v 5.6.143
Major bugs in the setup program fixed and new "Advanced" 
option added.

v 5.4.134
A 'Second' counter in shut down window and overflow error
fixed.

v 5.3.128
The program now finds the licencsed owner of the machine.

v 5.2.127
New option ; "Re-load SysTray Icon" comes in handy if
for some reason the system tray is re-set.

v 5.1.115
A few minor bugs from the new background screen fixed.

v 5.0.108
Again, I've improved the data entry on the shut-down
options screen. Also I've no included a 'Background'
option on the main menu. You can set a picture or logo
into the background of the clock. There is a preview 
screen to help you decide wich picture you want and 
you can turn off the background to your clock background 
colours (the colours menu).
The jump in version numbers (from .70 to .108) was mainly
caused by me tracking down an error that only occured in
the .exe, hence I had to make a lot of .exe's to find and
cure the problem.

- Eric
========================================================
v 4.0.70

You can now change the colours of the various parts of
clock. The colour options are on the main menu and are
self-explanitory. I've also added an icon the the startbar
to help close and show the clock.

- Eric
========================================================
v 3.4.61

You can now set the shut down times for any particular
day. Also in version 3.4.61, the time entry system was
improved so most of what's described for V2.3.45 
Shut down options doesn't really apply anymore.
{ReadMe help updated} 

Please don't screw around with the SetClock.ini file or 
the program could do some weird things.

WARRANTY
CompApp owns the copyright of this program but takes
no responsability, implied or otherwise, for any damage 
to any part of your computer (including, but not limited
to, not saving any data in applications active before
shutting down the computer, improper operation
as a result of someone screwing around with the
.ini file, corrupt data, windows errors etc.) as a 
result of running this program. 
========================================================

To use the Timed Shutdown clock, just run it by
clicking on the shortcut in your Programs folder
on the Start menu.

INSTALLING
Versions greater then v2.0.34
Just run the Setup.exe after unzipping the file.
If you using WinZip, it will let you install
without unzipping.

v 2.0.34
For those who are new to this, this means that
you click on the 'Start' button, go to 'Find'
and click on 'Files or Folders...'. You should
see a flashing line in a white box with 'Named'
written beside it. Type in 'CompApp*.exe' and 
press the [RETURN] key. If you see a file called
'CompAppClock.exe' in the white box that just 
appeared, then doule-click on it to run the clock.

v 6.1.187
Basically the same procedure as described in 
v 2.0.34, but search for a file called 
"Clock Setup*.exe" and run the program to install the
clock.

v 7.0.357
If downloaded from the internet, the program will be in
zip format. You will need a zip extracter such as 
WinZip (tm) to extract the setup files. You can download 
WinZip from; http://www.winzip.com
Using WinZip, open the zip file (either tsc70Ful.zip or
tsc70min.zip). On the WinZip toolbar (v7+), there is a
button called Install. Click on this and it will start
the setup process for the Timed Shutdown Clock. If you
used another zip utility to extract the setup files 
from the zip file, then go to the folder where you 
extracted the files and run Setup.exe to start the 
setup process.

KNOWN PROBLEMS (v 6.4 or previous versions)
There really is only one known problem. The clock has
been known to cause slowdown with other vb (visual 
basic) programs. This is due to the clock using off-
screen bitmaps. It keeps a background constantly which
slows the computer down by taking up ram (not a whole
lot, say 100-200 Kilobytes, plus program size).


USING
There are two menus associated with the clock. The
first menu can be accessed from the clock icon (the
picture of a clock with a black border on the task bar),
and moving the cursor over the icon and pressing the 
right mouse button. You will see a menu of the 
following;

     +------------+
  i) | Show Clock |
     |------------|
 ii) | Quit       |
     +------------+

i)  Show
This will display the clock for you if it is not 
currently visible

ii) Quit
Use this to exit the program completely. The program 
will remain active (and the clock icon will remain on
the task bar) if the clock has been set to shut the 
computer down at a predefined time.


To access the clocks main menu, right-click anywhere 
on the clock window (if it is not visible, then select
the Show option from the menu described above. You
should then see a menu appear with;

       +---------------------+
(i)    | 24 Hour             |
(ii)   | Analogue            |
       |---------------------|
(iii)  | Alarm Settings...   |
(iv)   | Display Settings... |
       |---------------------|
(v)    | Password           >|
(vi)   | Advanced           >|
       |---------------------|
(vii)  | About               |
       |---------------------|
(viii) | Exit                |
       +---------------------+

(i) 24 Hour
If this option has a tick beside it, then it means
that the digital clock is running in 24 hour mode.
Selecting this option again will turn it off and
the digital clock will display 12 hour mode.


(ii) Analogue
If this option has a tick beside it, then you
should be seeing a clock face on top of a digital
clock. Selecting this option again turns it off.


(v) Alarm Settings...
When you click on this option you should be
presented with another screen. On this screen is
an etched box on the left half titled 
"Daily Settings". These affect the day-to-day 
shutdown times and settings. Daily settings are
only implemented when the Ok button is pressed.
On the right side of the screen are settings that
affect the shutdown no matter what day it is. These
settings are implemented immediatly but are not 
saved until the Ok button has been pressed

Daily Settings
Select the day you wish to set a time for an whether
of not you wish the program to shutdown on that day.
Selecting the Confirm Shutdown option will ask the
user to either confirm shutdown or cancel it. The 
amount of time the program wait for this response is
set by the Wait For box. The time is specified in
seconds. Should the time expire, the program 
automatically shuts down the computer.

Shutdown Method
This box is on the top-right of the screen. You can
specify the method to shutdown the computer if the
default (Shut Down) does not work on you particular
computer. Please note that "Force Close" and 
"Power Down" will shutdown the computer IMMEDIATLY
without saving any data. Vital information may be 
lost if you have an important program running.

Idle Shutdown
This option, if turned on, will shutdown your computer
after your computer has been idle for a specified amount
of time.
You can turn this option on by making sure there is a 
check mark in the "Idle Shutdown On" box.
The minimum amount of time you can specify to wait for is
one minute. The maximum is 23 hours, 59 minutes.


(iv) Display Settings
This will display a window with a preview pane on the left
side of the screen. This windows will affect the visual
appearance of the clock. These settings are only applied
to the clock when the Ok button is pressed.

Picture
You can specify a picture for the background. The picture
type must (currently) be a bitmap (*.bmp). Other file
types are planned to be supported in subsequent versions.

Style
You can specify how to display the background picture or
you can specify not to display one at all. You can also
now set the background to the section of wallpaper 
covered by the clock. This helps the program blend in
to any desktop.

Colour
You can select a specific part of the colour to change the
colour of from the list. To change the colour, click on
the Colour button beside the drop-down box and select a
new colour.

Schemes
Once you have selected and changed the colours you wish,
you can save your changes as a colour scheme. To do this,
make your changes first. Then type the name of the new
colour scheme into the Scheme drop-down box and click the
Save Button.
To display a previously saved colour scheme, select one
from the list and click the Apply button. This only 
applies the colours to the Preview box, not the clock.
This will also update colours in the Colour drop-down box.
Do delete a colour scheme, select one from the list and
click the Delete button.

     password. If no password is currently set, 
     then, the program will ask you for one.

  2) 'Password Enabled'
     Only available after you have both set a password
     and you have entered it into the program.

  3) 'Lock Menu'

	suppose the option is checked and you just opened
	Microsoft Word. The program will still be visible,
	even though your using Word.

  b) Run At StartUp
	If checked, then the program will run every time
	windows starts. If unchecked, the program will
	NOT run every time windows starts and will require
	you to run it from the start menu.

  c) Snap Clock
        This will snap the clock to the side of the screen
        is the clock edge is within 10 pixels of the 
        screen edge. Should the clock be dragged outside
        the bounds of the screen, the clock is moved so 
        that the entire window area is shown.

  d) Start Minimized
	If this option is checked, the program will appear
	as a icon on top of the Start-bar, even if you 
	restart the program.

  e) Start Hidden
	If this option is checked, the program will only
	be visible as the clock icon in your system tray
	(the area usually to the right of the start bar).
	You can display the clock by double-clickin the
	left mouse button on the mensioned clock icon.

  f) Change System Time
        This will allow you to change the time on the
        computer. For WinNT/Win2000 users, this is only
        allowed provided you have the privilages to do so.

  g) Re-Load System Tray Icon
	Just click on this option if you can't see the 
	clock icon on the right hand side of the start
	bar.

  h), i), j), k) and l)
        These will shutdown the computer immediatly using
        the selected option. If you select the Force Close
        or the Power Down options, please make sure you 
        have no critical programs running as important
        data may be lost.

(vii) About
Show information about the clock and where to
contact me if you have any trouble. Click 'Ok'
to get rid of the window.


(viii) Exit
Guess what this does :) 

Note: the program will not completely exit if the 
"Timed Shutdown" option is checked, but you
can close the program properly by right-clicking
on the clock icon in the system tray (the box on the
righthand side of the startbar), and selecting "Quit"


========================================================
